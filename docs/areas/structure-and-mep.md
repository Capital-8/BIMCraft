# Structure and the discipline tabs (Plumbing, Electrical, SPDA, Data)

Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`, word for word: the root keeps the rules and the map, and this file is read when the area is touched.

Structure (`runs.rs`, `structure.rs`; the design for the five discipline tabs is in [docs/disciplines.md](../disciplines.md)). A run
(`model::Run`) is a straight element from `start` to `end` in plan; its `offset` mm over its level is the height of its `justify` line
(top, centre or bottom) at the start, `end_offset` at the end (level when none), `system` the name of the system it is in: a beam, a
strip footing, a pipe (Plumbing), and what the other tabs draw (conduits, cable trays, down conductors, data cabling) as further
`Element` variants over the same struct, as `Door` and `Window` share `Opening`; `model::run_arm!` is the pattern for any of them, so a
place that treats runs alike names no category, and a new category is a line there. Its type is `Types::runs[category][name]`, a `RunType`
(`width` across by `depth` deep, or round, in a `material` of the library). The section is square to the axis, so a sloped run is
`depth / cos θ` deep vertically (`Geom::half`). `runs::Geom` is the one place that knows the geometry (centre line, `footprint`,
`prism` for a rectangle, `tube` for a round one, `z_span`); plans, sections (a prism is cut like any solid; a tube by the plane
through the section's line, `Solid::cuts`: the hull of where its edges cross it, a ring, an ellipse when oblique), 3D, snaps and IFC call
it and know no category. A run's heights are those of its `justify` line, which a beam or a footing has at the top by default and
anything else at the middle (`runs::default_justify`); the desktop keeps each run tool's own justification and offset
(`keep_run_options`). A beam or strip footing can't stand or lean past 75°
(`runs::check`, `may_stand`: what stands is a column; a pipe, a conduit or a conductor may stand, a riser). In plan (`render::stands`) a footing or a run
hangs under the level it is drawn on, its top flush with the view's bottom, and is seen (`seen_below` allows `TOL` for these only,
or a wall of the storey below would show in the plan above); through the cut plane it's cut; over it and under the view range's top
it's dashed; a faint dashed centre line is drawn where it's seen or overhead, which is also where a click picks it. A structural column and an
isolated footing are `Column`s in their own categories (`Element::StructuralColumn`, `Element::Footing`; ask `Element::column()`,
`Model::column_type(e)` and `column_outline(e)`, which take the element, not the column) with types of their own
(`Types::structural_column`, `Types::footing`); a footing is laid down, its `height` its thickness and its `base_offset` putting its
top at the level (the command's `thickness` and `offset`). A floor is `structural` or not, the one flag, and its schedule and IFC say it.
`runs_of` and `stood_of` build what a command would make, so a tool's sketch is the element its click makes. The desktop's
`Tool::Run(category, start)` and `Tool::Stand(category)` serve every category: a tab adds a ribbon button and its rows in
`structure.rs`, `properties.rs` and `lang.rs`, not a tool. The Floor tool makes structural floors while `floor_structural` is set (SB,
the Structure tab's button; every other `set_tool` clears it); CL is the structural column on the Structure tab and the architectural one
elsewhere, as in Revit. IFC writes a run as an extrusion along its own axis (`Step::body_along`, `aim`) of the class and predefined type
the one table `runs::IFC` gives its category (import reads the same table back, `runs::from_ifc`), each structural element with
`LoadBearing` in its `Pset_*Common`, a run's system as an `IfcSystem` (named for it, its GlobalIds following the name) the runs in it
are assigned to by an `IfcRelAssignsToGroup`, its `Justification` and `Category` in `BIMCraft_Run`, and its material as an `IfcMaterial`.
Import (`import::run_in`) finds a run's axis as the direction its body's points spread furthest in (power iteration on their
covariance), so a beam rolled about its axis comes in as the box round it; an axis that stands (a riser) has its width along east and
runs up; the justification BIMCraft wrote puts the heights back on the line they were typed at (`Geom::half`), none meaning the middle;
a system comes from the IfcSystem the product is assigned to, and its category from the class and type, or BIMCraft's `Category`
where a class has several; `LoadBearing` makes a column or a floor structural.

**Sizing** is a command with no model behind it, so it needs no connectors: `circuit` (`nbr5410.rs`, its tables in `nbr5410/tables.rs` as NBR 5410:2004 prints them: Tabelas 36 and 37 current capacity for methods A1 to D, 40 and 41 temperature and soil, 42 and 45 grouping, 47, 48 and 58) sizes one electrical circuit for copper: the design current from watts or VA, the demand and power factors and the phases at the project's voltage system, then the smallest section and breaker with I_B ≤ I_n ≤ I_Z (which gives I_2 = 1.45 I_n ≤ 1.45 I_Z for the breakers of NBR NM 60898) and a voltage drop within the limit (4 %, from the conductor's resistance at its working temperature and 0.1 ohm/km), with the neutral and the protective conductor. A section or breaker already chosen is never made smaller. It does not check aluminium, trays (methods E and F), several layers, short circuit, harmonics or the conditions of a reduced neutral, and says so; a circuit in the model and a panel schedule come after it. `conduit_fill` (`conduit.rs`, its catalogues in `conduit/tables.rs`) checks a conduit's fill: the conductors of a circuit (phases, neutral, protective; by outside diameter) over the conduit's inside, at most 53 % for one cable, 31 % for two and 40 % for three or more (NBR 5410), and the smallest size of a family that takes them. The dimensions are the makers' own (Amanco Wavin PVC, Elecon steel, Corfio flexible cable), each family naming its document, page and address; the inside diameter is derived (outside less twice the wall); a cable the catalogue lacks (EPR, above 240 mm²) leaves the fill pending, never guessed. Trays are not sized.

The discipline tabs after Structure add data to this, no engine code of their own. Plumbing: `pipe` (PI), types in PVC and copper
(`Types::runs["pipe"]`, outside diameters, so a pipe's `width` is its diameter and its schedule says Diameter). Electrical: `conduit`
(CN), `cabletray` (CT, `cable_tray`: the one rectangular run) and `wire` (EW), by their outside size. Lightning protection (NBR 5419):
`downconductor` (DC, may stand: a riser down a wall) and `groundconductor` (GC), two runs of one IFC class that `BIMCraft_Run`'s `Category`
tells apart; an air terminal, an earthing electrode and an inspection box are components of their own family categories, written as
`IfcBuildingElementProxy` of the object type `Category::ifc` names, so the product's name (not its object type) holds `Family:Type` and
import reads it from there. Data (NBR 14565): `cable` (CB, `cabling`), a run like a wire, so a file's `IfcCableSegment` is a wire unless its
`Category` says cable; data and voice outlets (`IfcOutlet` `DATAOUTLET`, `TELEPHONEOUTLET`; one of no type reads as the power outlet,
`Category::from_ifc` taking the first of equals), a patch panel (`IfcCommunicationsAppliance`) and a rack (a proxy of object type `Rack`);
the Cable Tray tool is the Electrical tab's, on the Data tab too. A fixture or a
device is a component of a family whose `family::Category` says what it is (a sanitary fixture, a floor drain, a pipe fitting, a pipe
accessory…); `Category::ifc` is its IFC class, predefined type and, where IFC has no class (lightning protection), the object type a
proxy carries, and `Category::from_ifc` reads the same table back, so a category is one row, in `family.rs`. The starter families are
`fixtures.rs` (original forms, named in the project's language; a fitting or a valve is centred on its pipe, along x, so placing it at the
pipe's height lines them up; a wall device, a board and a luminaire carry their `Mounting Height` in their type, so the Fixture tool
places them at the level and they stand where they hang). The desktop's `mep.rs` has one tool for every fixture and device, `Tool::Fixture(key)`: the families of the
kinds its `FixtureTool` names, listed in its Type Selector and placed as the Component tool places them (`placing` takes the tool's
kinds), and the tabs' ribbon panels; a fixture's two-letter shortcut is in `mep::FIXTURES`, not `SHORTCUTS`, since no command makes
one. Edit Type of a run type also sets whether it is round (a diameter, no depth) and its material.
